Introduction
------------
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This project aims to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data and provide a tool for early lung cancer detection.

Features
--------
- Preprocessing tools for medical imaging data.
- Deep learning models for lung cancer classification.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

Installation
------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yusufshihata/LungCancerDetector.git
   cd LungCancerDetector

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

Usage
-----
- To train the model:
  python train.py --data_path ./data --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

- To make predictions:
  python predict.py --image_path ./data/test_image.png

- To evaluate the model:
  python evaluate.py --data_path ./data/test_set

Dataset
-------
The dataset consists of labeled CT scans and X-ray images. You can use publicly available datasets such as LUNA16 or ChestX-ray8. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory and split it into `train`, `validation`, and `test` folders.

Model Architecture
------------------
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Key components include:
- Input Layer: Accepts medical images (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
- Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images.
- Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions.
- Fully Connected Layers: Classify the extracted features.
- Output Layer: Provides a probability score for lung cancer.

Results
-------
The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:
- Accuracy: 92.5%
- Precision: 91.8%
- Recall: 93.2%
- F1-Score: 92.5%
