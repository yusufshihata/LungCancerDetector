## Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data and provide a tool for early lung cancer detection.

The repository includes:
- Preprocessing scripts for medical imaging data.
- Deep learning models for lung cancer classification.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tools to clean, normalize, and augment medical imaging data.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Pre-trained and custom models for lung cancer detection.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use scripts for training and inference.
